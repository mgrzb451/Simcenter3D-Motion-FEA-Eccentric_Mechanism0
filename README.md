# Simcenter 3D - Flexible Body Motion Simulation - Simple Eccentric Mechanism
Let's explore Flexible Body Simulation in Simceneter 3D by analysing a simple Eccentric Mechanism!

# Axial Stress Comparison with Static Analysis
By manually calculating the peak Force exerted by the spring on the Link we get a max tensile stress of `9.62 MPa`. This value is confirmed through Linear Static Analysis

# Axial Stress on the Flexible Body
The Flexible Body simulation yields a result that is **4x** higher! Is the difference caused by the dynamic nature of the Loading? Can it account for this great an increase? 🤔

That requires further verification and that means **more** projects! 😃
